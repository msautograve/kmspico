## Who is this program suitable for

For myself, I concluded that this program is great for educational institutions and small offices. Why is that? yes, because many students and small businesses do not have a large budget for expensive software. This leads to the fact that free activation is the only way out. I did an analysis and realized that KMSpico is very popular in Brazil, India and the Philippines. In these countries, the number of office workers is growing, but the budget does not allow you to buy a license for Microsoft products on time.
